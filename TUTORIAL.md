# MusicScene — Getting Started Tutorial

This walks you through using the **MusicScene** addon in a brand-new Godot project, first in
**2D** and then in **3D**. By the end you'll be creating objects, displaying a music score,
driving physics, and receiving collision/interaction events — all over OSC from an external
client.

> Same OSC API in both dimensions. The only difference is one project setting (`musicscene/space`)
> and whether your main scene is a `Node2D` or a `Node3D`.

## 0. Prerequisites

- **Godot 4.4+** (developed and verified on **4.7**).
- The **`addons/musicscene/`** folder from this repository.
- An **OSC client**. This tutorial uses a tiny Python script (section 2); Max/Pd/SuperCollider
  notes are in section 11.

You do **not** need any third-party Godot OSC library — MusicScene has its own UDP OSC codec.

---

## 1. Install the addon into a new project

1. **Create a project**: Godot Project Manager → *New Project* → e.g. `MyScoreWorld` → *Create & Edit*.
2. **Copy the addon**: copy the `addons/musicscene/` folder into your project so you have
   `res://addons/musicscene/`. (Drag it into the FileSystem dock, or copy on disk and let Godot
   import it.)
3. **Enable the plugin**: *Project → Project Settings → Plugins* → enable **MusicScene**.
   Enabling it installs an **autoload singleton** named **`MusicSceneOSC`** (the controller that runs
   the OSC server and owns every subsystem).
4. **Verify**: press **Play** (you can run an empty scene for now and dismiss the "no main scene"
   prompt by picking any scene, or just continue to section 4). In the **Output** panel you should
   see:

   ```
   [MusicSceneOSC] OSC server listening on udp:7400, replies -> 127.0.0.1:7401
   [MusicSceneOSC] ready (space=2d). Send /ms/ping to test.
   ```

That's it — the OSC server is live on **UDP 7400** (it sends replies/events to the last sender's
IP on **UDP 7401**).

> **Settings are optional.** MusicScene reads every setting with a sensible default, so it works
> with zero configuration. You only need to add a setting when you want to change a default — most
> importantly `musicscene/space = "3d"` for the 3D walkthrough (section 5).

---

## 2. A tiny OSC client

Save this as **`gosc.py`** somewhere handy. It sends `/ms/...` messages and prints anything
MusicScene sends back. (A fuller version ships at `tools/osc_test.py` in this repo.)

```python
# gosc.py — minimal OSC client for MusicScene
import socket, struct, threading, time

HOST, SEND_PORT, RECV_PORT = "127.0.0.1", 7400, 7401

def _pad(b): return b + b"\x00" * ((4 - len(b) % 4) % 4)
def _ostr(s): return _pad(s.encode() + b"\x00")

def msg(addr, *args):
    tt, payload = ",", b""
    for a in args:
        if isinstance(a, bool):  tt += "T" if a else "F"
        elif isinstance(a, int): tt += "i"; payload += struct.pack(">i", a)
        elif isinstance(a, float): tt += "f"; payload += struct.pack(">f", a)
        else: tt += "s"; payload += _ostr(str(a))
    return _ostr(addr) + _ostr(tt) + payload

def _rstr(d, i):
    e = d.index(b"\x00", i); s = d[i:e].decode("utf-8", "replace"); i = e + 1
    return s, i + ((4 - i % 4) % 4)

def decode(d):
    if d[:8] == b"#bundle\x00":
        out, i = [], 16
        while i + 4 <= len(d):
            n = struct.unpack_from(">i", d, i)[0]; i += 4
            out += decode(d[i:i+n]); i += n
        return out
    addr, i = _rstr(d, 0)
    if i >= len(d): return [(addr, [])]
    tt, i = _rstr(d, i); args = []
    for c in tt[1:]:
        if c == "i": args.append(struct.unpack_from(">i", d, i)[0]); i += 4
        elif c == "f": args.append(round(struct.unpack_from(">f", d, i)[0], 4)); i += 4
        elif c in "sS": v, i = _rstr(d, i); args.append(v)
        elif c == "T": args.append(True)
        elif c == "F": args.append(False)
        elif c in "htd": i += 8
    return [(addr, args)]

_recv = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
_recv.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
_recv.bind((HOST, RECV_PORT)); _recv.settimeout(0.3)
_send = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

def _listen():
    while True:
        try: data, _ = _recv.recvfrom(65535)
        except socket.timeout: continue
        for a, ar in decode(data): print("  <-", a, ar)
threading.Thread(target=_listen, daemon=True).start()

def s(addr, *args):
    _send.sendto(msg(addr, *args), (HOST, SEND_PORT))
    print("->", addr, list(args)); time.sleep(0.05)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import code; code.interact(local=globals())   # interactive: type s("/ms/ping")
```

Run it with `python gosc.py` (or `py gosc.py` on Windows) for an interactive prompt where you can
type `s("/ms/ping")`, or `import gosc` from your own script.

---

## 3. Smoke test: ping

With your Godot project **running**, in the `gosc.py` prompt:

```python
s("/ms/ping")          # ->  <- /ms/pong []
s("/ms/version")       # ->  <- /ms/reply ['version', '0.1.0']
s("/ms/info")          # ->  <- /ms/reply ['info', 'MusicScene', ...]
```

If you see `<- /ms/pong`, you're connected. If not, jump to [Troubleshooting](#13-troubleshooting).

---

## 4. Getting started in 2D

### 4.1 Make a 2D main scene

1. *Scene → New Scene → 2D Scene* (creates a `Node2D` root). Rename it `Main`, **save** as
   `res://Main.tscn`.
2. *Project → Project Settings → Application → Run* → set **Main Scene** to `res://Main.tscn`.

You don't need a camera. MusicScene parents the objects it creates under its own autoload node and
renders them in the viewport.

> 2D is the default (`musicscene/space` defaults to `"2d"`), so there's nothing else to configure.

### 4.2 Coordinates

Default **normalized** coordinates: `x ∈ [-1,1]` left→right, `y ∈ [-1,1]` bottom→top (y-up), with
`(0,0)` at the viewport centre. (You can switch to `pixels`/`world` with `/ms/app/coord`.)

### 4.3 Create your first objects

Press **Play**, then from `gosc.py`:

```python
s("/ms/scene/title", "new", "text", "Hello, score-world")
s("/ms/scene/title", "pos", 0.0, 0.8)
s("/ms/scene/title", "color", 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0)

s("/ms/scene/box", "new", "rect")
s("/ms/scene/box", "pos", -0.4, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/box", "color", 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, 1.0)

s("/ms/scene/ball", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/ball", "pos", 0.4, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/ball", "scale", 1.5)
```

You should see a title, a blue rectangle, and a circle appear. Every object shares the same
commands: `show/hide`, `pos/x/y`, `size/scale/rotate`, `opacity/color`, `del`, etc. Query them:

```python
s("/ms/scene/list")              # <- reply scene/list title box ball
s("/ms/scene/ball", "dump")      # <- reply dump ball circle created_by_osc pos ...
s("/ms/scene/ball", "capabilities")
```

**Reading replies.** Every query answers on `/ms/reply` as `<topic> <id> <values…>` — arg 0 is
the topic (which query it answers), arg 1 is the object id, the rest are the result. For example
`/ms/reply ['capabilities', 'ball', 'transform', 'input']` means object `ball` currently has the
`transform` and `input` capabilities.

**Capabilities** tell you what an object supports right now (they change as you enable features):

| flag | meaning | when present |
|---|---|---|
| `transform` | pos/x/y/z, scale, rotate, opacity, color, show/hide, size | always |
| `input` | clickable/hoverable (`/on click\|down\|up\|drag\|enter\|leave`) | always |
| `physics` | has a physics body | after `…/physics enable <static\|rigid\|area>` (or bound to a physics node) |
| `collision` | emits collision/area events | once physics is enabled |
| `notation` | a score object (pages/cursor/regions/measures/notes) | created with `new notation` |
| `customProperties` | `prop` / `getProp` allowed | object exposes properties (OscExposable/meta), or developer mode |
| `customMethods` | `call` allowed | object exposes methods, or developer mode |
| `signals` | Godot signals available to forward | object exposes signals |

So a plain `circle` reports `transform input`; after `…/physics enable rigid` + a collider it reports
`transform physics collision input`.

### 4.4 Animate with the transport

`map` interpolates a property over transport time:

```python
s("/ms/scene/ball", "map", 0.0, 4.0, "x", 0.4, -0.9)   # slide x over 4 seconds
s("/ms/transport", "tempo", 120.0)
s("/ms/transport", "play")
s("/ms/transport", "pause")     # halt at the current time
s("/ms/transport", "stop")      # halt and reset time to 0
s("/ms/transport", "seek", 2.0) # jump to 2.0 seconds
s("/ms/transport", "state")     # <- reply transport state playing|stopped <time> <tempo>
```

Transport commands: `play`, `pause`, `stop`, `seek <seconds>`, `tempo <bpm>`, and the queries
`time`, `beat`, `state`.

### 4.5 Display a music score

Point a `notation` object at any PNG (export one from MuseScore/LilyPond/Verovio, or use the
bundled `res://scores/page1.png` if you copied it):

```python
s("/ms/scene/score", "new", "notation")
s("/ms/scene/score", "notation", "png", "res://scores/page1.png")
s("/ms/scene/score", "pos", 0.0, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/score", "scale", 0.9)
# a red playback cursor (page coords are [0,1])
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor", "show", 1)
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor", "color", 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.8)
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor", "map", 0.0, 8.0, "x", 0.05, 0.95)   # sweep with transport
# a clickable region over measure 1
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "rect", 0.1, 0.25, 0.2, 0.1)
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "highlight", 1)
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "on", "click", "/score/measure")
s("/ms/scene/score", "notationInfo")   # <- reply notationInfo score png ... image 1
```

Click the highlighted region in the Godot window → you receive `/score/measure score m1 <u> <v>`.

> SVG works too (`notation svg "res://scores/page.svg"`). MusicXML/MEI/LilyPond route to an
> external engraver you configure in Project Settings (`musicscene/notation/external_renderer_*`).

### 4.6 Physics and collision → OSC

```python
# a static floor
s("/ms/scene/floor", "new", "rect")
s("/ms/scene/floor", "pos", 0.0, -0.8)
s("/ms/scene/floor", "size", 1.8, 0.05)
s("/ms/scene/floor/physics", "enable", "static")
s("/ms/scene/floor/collider", "rect", 1.8, 0.05)

# a bouncing note that emits OSC when it lands
s("/ms/scene/note1", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/note1", "pos", 0.0, 0.9)
s("/ms/scene/note1/physics", "enable", "rigid")
s("/ms/scene/note1/collider", "circle", 0.05)
s("/ms/scene/note1/physics", "bounce", 0.7)
s("/ms/scene/note1/on", "collisionEnter", "/synth/hit", "minIntensity", 0.05, "cooldown", 0.05)
s("/ms/scene/note1/payload", "collisionEnter", "self", "other", "intensity", "x", "y", "time")

# turn on gravity (normalized: negative y = down)
s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)
s("/ms/physics", "gravity", 0.0, -0.6)
```

The note falls and on impact you receive e.g. `/synth/hit note1 floor 0.42 0.0 -0.8 3.12`, plus a
canonical `/ms/event/physics ...`. Map intensity to a synth and you have a physical score.

### 4.7 Bind an existing node and forward its signal

To control nodes that already exist in your scene, mark them **exposed**:

1. In `Main.tscn`, add a **Button** (Control). Add a child **Node**, attach the script
   `res://addons/musicscene/nodes/OscExposable.gd` to it (or add it via *Add Node → OscExposable*),
   and set its `osc_id` to `playButton`. Leave `osc_auto_bind` on.
2. Press Play. The button is auto-bound. Forward its `pressed` signal:

   ```python
   s("/ms/scene/playButton/signal", "pressed", "/ui/play")
   ```

   Click the button → you receive `/ui/play playButton pressed`.

To bind a node on demand instead of auto-binding, point the addon at a root and use a relative
path:

```python
s("/ms/app/root", "/root/Main")
s("/ms/bindRel", "myNode", "SomeChild/Path")
```

> By default only **exposed** nodes can be bound (safe default). For quick prototyping, set
> `musicscene/developer_mode = true` to bind/call/set anything.

---

## 5. Getting started in 3D

Everything you just learned applies — objects become 3D, coordinates gain a `z`, and notation
renders on a quad in world space.

### 5.1 Switch to 3D

Add the project setting **`musicscene/space = "3d"`**. Two easy ways:

- **Editor:** *Project → Project Settings*, turn on *Advanced Settings*, in the property box type
  `musicscene/space`, set type *String*, value `3d`, click **Add**.
- **Text:** add to `project.godot`:

  ```ini
  [MusicScene]
  space="3d"
  ```

The setting is read once at startup, so **restart** the running project after changing it.

### 5.2 Make a 3D main scene

1. *Scene → New Scene → 3D Scene* (creates a `Node3D` root). Rename `Main`, save as
   `res://Main3D.tscn`, and set it as the **Main Scene**.
2. (Optional) add a `DirectionalLight3D` so any *non-MusicScene* meshes are lit. MusicScene's own
   primitives use unshaded materials, so they're visible without a light.

When you Play, MusicScene **auto-creates a `Camera3D`** if your scene doesn't have one, looking at
the origin. You'll see in the console:

```
[MusicSceneOSC] auto-created Camera3D at z=10.4
[MusicSceneOSC] ready (space=3d). Send /ms/ping to test.
```

### 5.3 3D coordinates

Normalized `x/y/z ∈ [-1,1]`, y-up, **+z toward the camera**, mapped to a world cube of half-extent
5 units. Commands take an optional `z`.

### 5.4 Create 3D objects

```python
s("/ms/scene/box", "new", "rect")          # rect -> a flat quad
s("/ms/scene/box", "pos", -0.4, 0.2, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/box", "rotate", 0, 30, 0)     # full Euler degrees (x y z)

s("/ms/scene/ball", "new", "circle")       # circle -> a sphere
s("/ms/scene/ball", "pos", 0.4, 0.2, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/ball", "color", 0.95, 0.55, 0.45, 1.0)

s("/ms/scene/label", "new", "text", "3D score-world")  # text -> Label3D
s("/ms/scene/label", "pos", 0.0, 0.8, 0.0)
```

### 5.5 Notation on a quad in world space

```python
s("/ms/scene/score", "new", "notation")
s("/ms/scene/score", "notation", "png", "res://scores/page1.png")
s("/ms/scene/score", "pos", -0.4, 0.1, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/score", "rotate", 0, -18, 0)   # angle the page in 3D
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor", "show", 1)
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor", "map", 0.0, 8.0, "x", 0.05, 0.95)
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "rect", 0.1, 0.22, 0.25, 0.085)
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "highlight", 1)
s("/ms/scene/score/region", "m1", "on", "click", "/score/measure")
s("/ms/transport", "play")
```

The cursor, region and annotations live on the quad's surface and rotate/scale with it. Clicking
the region uses a camera ray vs the quad plane and emits `/score/measure score m1 <u> <v>`.

### 5.6 3D physics + colliders

3D adds `box` and `sphere` colliders (and accepts `rect`→box, `circle`→sphere):

```python
# floor: a flat box
s("/ms/scene/floor", "new", "rect")
s("/ms/scene/floor", "pos", 0.0, -0.7, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/floor", "scale", 3, 0.15, 3)
s("/ms/scene/floor/physics", "enable", "static")
s("/ms/scene/floor/collider", "box", 0.9, 0.05, 0.9)

# falling note (sphere)
s("/ms/scene/note1", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/note1", "pos", 0.0, 0.8, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/note1/physics", "enable", "rigid")
s("/ms/scene/note1/collider", "sphere", 0.1)
s("/ms/scene/note1/physics", "bounce", 0.7)
s("/ms/scene/note1/on", "collisionEnter", "/synth/hit", "minIntensity", 0.05)
s("/ms/scene/note1/payload", "collisionEnter", "self", "other", "intensity", "x", "y", "z", "time")

s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)
s("/ms/physics", "gravity", 0.0, -0.6, 0.0)
```

### 5.7 Binding & clicking in 3D

Expose existing 3D nodes exactly as in 2D (`OscExposable` child with an `osc_id`). Click-picking
on objects uses the camera ray vs the object's bounding box, so any visible 3D object with a
`click`/`down`/`up`/`drag` binding is interactive:

```python
s("/ms/scene/ball/on", "click", "/hit/ball")
```

### Switching back to 2D

Set `musicscene/space = "2d"` (and choose a `Node2D` main scene) and restart. Same OSC scripts,
2D rendering.

---

## 6. Camera control (3D)

In 3D you can drive the camera over OSC (2D mode ignores these — it has no camera). Positions and
look-at points use the same normalized coordinates as everything else; angles are degrees.

```
s("/ms/camera", "pos", 0.0, 0.0, 1.2)      # move the camera (normalized)
s("/ms/camera", "lookAt", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)   # aim at a point
s("/ms/camera", "fov", 50)                 # field of view
s("/ms/camera", "projection", "orthographic")   # or "perspective" (default)
s("/ms/camera", "orthoSize", 1.2)          # orthographic extent (normalized)
s("/ms/camera", "target", "note")          # re-aim at 'note' every frame as it moves
s("/ms/camera", "follow", "note", 0.6)     # chase-cam: keep a fixed offset and aim at it
s("/ms/camera", "reset")                   # back to the default framing, tracking cleared
s("/ms/camera", "info")                    # -> /ms/reply camera pos ... fov ... projection ... tracking ...
```

`target` tracks orientation only (the camera stays put and keeps the object centred); `follow` also
moves the camera, keeping the offset it had when you called it (`dist` overrides that distance).
Setting `pos`/`lookAt`/`reset` stops tracking. If a tracked object is removed, tracking stops.

### Clearing vs resetting the scene

- `s("/ms/scene", "clear")` removes scene objects, joints and time-maps, but keeps global config
  (physics on/off, gravity, camera) — good for swapping content mid-performance.
- `s("/ms/scene", "reset")` is a full **like-first-run** reset: it clears all of the above **and**
  disables physics, zeroes gravity, resets the camera to its default framing, drops buffered events,
  and restores default coordinate modes. Safety settings (permissions, the scene whitelist, developer
  mode) and the transport are preserved. Use `reset` between takes so a rebuild behaves like the first
  run (in particular, physics is off again while you position objects).

---

## 7. Physical notation: joints

Joints constrain physics bodies into strings, hinges, and springs. They live in their own namespace,
`/ms/joint/<id>`, with their own id space. Both endpoints must be scene objects with physics
enabled; at least one must be non-static.

```
s("/ms/joint/<id>", "new", "<type>", "<a>", "<b>")
s("/ms/joint/<id>", "<property>", <args...>)
s("/ms/joint/<id>", "del")
```

**Types are native per space** (set via `musicscene/space`):

| | 2D | 3D |
|---|---|---|
| types | `pin`, `spring`/`dampedSpring`, `groove`, `distance` | `pin`, `hinge`, `slider`, `coneTwist`, `generic6dof` |

**Properties** (each applies where the joint supports it; otherwise a logged no-op):

| verb | meaning |
|---|---|
| `stiffness <0..1>` / `damping <0..1>` | spring feel (normalized, mapped per backend) |
| `restLength <norm>` | spring equilibrium length (normalized, coord-mapped); no-op on 3D `slider` (use `generic6dof` for a true linear spring) |
| `limit <lower> <upper>` | angular joints: **degrees**; linear (slider/groove): **norm length** |
| `motor <speed> <torque>` | 2D `pin`: target velocity (torque is a no-op in 2D). 3D `hinge`: target velocity + torque→max impulse |
| `axis <x> <y> <z>` | 3D working axis for `hinge`/`slider`/`coneTwist` (default A→B) |
| `dof <linX..angZ\|lin\|ang\|all>` | `generic6dof` only — selects which DOF later params target |
| `breakForce <0..1>` | snaps the joint when overstretched; emits `/ms/event/jointBreak <id> <a> <b>` |
| `del` | remove the joint |

Queries: `/ms/joint/<id> info`, `/ms/joints list`.

### 2D example — a note hanging from a string

```
s("/ms/scene/anchor", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/anchor/physics", "enable", "static")
s("/ms/scene/anchor", "pos", 0.0, 0.6, 0.0)

s("/ms/scene/note", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/note/physics", "enable", "rigid")
s("/ms/scene/note", "pos", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)

s("/ms/joint/string1", "new", "dampedSpring", "anchor", "note")
s("/ms/joint/string1", "stiffness", 0.8)
s("/ms/joint/string1", "damping", 0.1)
s("/ms/joint/string1", "restLength", 0.4)

s("/ms/physics", "gravity", 0.0, -1.0, 0.0)
s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)     # the note bobs on the spring
```

### 3D example — a swinging hinge

```
s("/ms/scene/post", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/post/physics", "enable", "static")
s("/ms/scene/post", "pos", 0.0, 0.5, 0.0)

s("/ms/scene/arm", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/arm/physics", "enable", "rigid")
s("/ms/scene/arm", "pos", 0.2, 0.5, 0.0)

s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "new", "hinge", "post", "arm")
s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "axis", 0, 0, 1)          # swing in the XY plane
s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "limit", -60, 60)         # degrees
s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "motor", 2.0, 0.5)        # speed, torque

s("/ms/physics", "gravity", 0.0, -1.0, 0.0)
s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)
```

**What you'll see — and it's surprising:** the arm swings down and stops at a **diagonal**, *not*
straight down. That's the `limit` doing its job, not a bug. The arm's starting position — directly to
the **right** of the post — is the hinge's `0°` reference, so `limit -60 60` lets it rotate at most 60°
below horizontal. Straight down is `-90°`, which is **past** the limit, so it never gets there. The
`motor` then drives the hinge toward a fixed speed and the limit clamps it, so the arm comes to rest
against the lower limit rather than swinging freely.

To change what happens:

- **Make it hang straight down:** widen the limit — `s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "limit", -90, 90)` — or
  drop the `limit` line entirely. Now the arm can reach the bottom (`-90°`).
- **Turn it into a free swinging pendulum:** remove the `motor` line. A motor *forces* motion toward a
  target velocity and pins the arm at a limit; without it, gravity alone swings the arm and it damps to
  rest at the lowest point. (Pair this with the wider/no limit above so it can actually reach the
  bottom.)

### Damping — making a swing lose energy (not `friction`)

A hinge or spring has no built-in pivot friction, and a body's contact `friction`
(`/ms/scene/<id>/physics friction`) only acts when two surfaces actually **touch** — so it does
nothing to a freely swinging pendulum. To bleed energy out of a swing so it settles, give the moving
body **damping**:

```
s("/ms/scene/arm/physics", "damping", 0.5, 0.0)   # linear, angular  (per-second rates)
```

For a pendulum the **linear** term is the effective one — the swing energy lives in the arm's motion
along its arc; the angular term mainly slows a body spinning about its own axis. Higher values settle
it sooner: measured from a 90° release, `damping 0.5 0` decays to ~20° within a couple of swings,
while `damping 0 0` keeps swinging for a long time.

### Seeing your joints — `physics debug`

A joint is a *constraint*, not an object, so it has no visual of its own — an invisible hinge is easy
to lose track of. Turn on physics debug to draw every joint as an overlay:

```
s("/ms/physics", "debug", 1)    # collision shapes + joint overlays
s("/ms/physics", "debug", 0)    # off
```

Each joint shows a **line between its two bodies**, a small **pivot marker** at the anchor, and — for a
`hinge` or `slider` — the **working axis** you set with `axis` (drawn in magenta). The overlay tracks
the bodies as they move and is drawn on top, so it stays visible even behind other geometry. The same
flag also shows collision shapes, so you can see the colliders and the constraints together.

---

## 8. Sensors & trigger zones

An **area** is a sensor: it reports when bodies enter, leave, or stay inside it — ideal for form
sections, presence, and spatial triggers.

```
s("/ms/scene/zoneA", "new", "rect")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/physics", "enable", "area")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/collider", "rect", 0.4, 0.3)

s("/ms/scene/zoneA/on", "areaEnter", "/form/section")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/on", "areaExit",  "/form/leave")
```

Enter/exit fire as bodies cross the boundary. Add a **constant tag** to the payload with a `=` (or `'`)
prefix — handy for labelling which section fired:

```
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/payload", "areaEnter", "self", "other", "=A")
# -> /form/section zoneA note17 A
```

### Colliders are automatic — and sizing a manual one

When you `physics enable <rigid|static|area>`, MusicScene automatically gives the object a collision shape
matching its visible mesh (the same result as `collider auto`). So a body can collide, and be sensed by
an area, **out of the box** — no separate `collider` command required. The example below just works: the
hinge arm swings down through the zone and you get `/form/section` as it enters and `/form/leave` as it
leaves.

```
s("/ms/scene/post", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/post/physics", "enable", "static")
s("/ms/scene/post", "pos", 0.0, 0.5, 0.0)

s("/ms/scene/arm", "new", "circle")
s("/ms/scene/arm/physics", "enable", "rigid")    # collider auto-created to match the ball
s("/ms/scene/arm", "pos", 0.5, 0.5, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/arm/physics", "damping", 0.5, 0.0)  # bleed energy so it settles (see §7)

s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "new", "hinge", "post", "arm")
s("/ms/joint/hinge1", "axis", 0, 0, 1)           # free pendulum: no limit, no motor

s("/ms/scene/zoneA", "new", "rect")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/physics", "enable", "area")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/collider", "rect", 0.4, 0.3)  # optional: override the auto shape with an exact size
s("/ms/scene/zoneA", "pos", 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)       # centre = the bottom of the arc
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/on", "areaEnter", "/form/section")
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/on", "areaExit",  "/form/leave")

s("/ms/physics", "gravity", 0.0, -1.0, 0.0)
s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)
```

Two things worth knowing:

- **A joint doesn't need colliders** to move its bodies — the hinge swings the arm regardless. What the
  auto collider adds is the geometry an area (or a collision event) needs to *detect* the body. Bodies
  joined together are excluded from colliding with *each other*, so the arm and post never knock heads.
- **Give the zone an explicit `pos`.** Without one a new object sits at the origin — which happens to be
  the bottom of this arc, but relying on that is fragile.

**Overriding the auto shape.** Pass a `collider` command whenever you want an exact shape or size; it
replaces the automatic one. When you set a size by hand, mind the units:

> Collider sizes use the **physics coordinate mode** — in normalized 3D they're multiplied by the world
> half-extent (×5), while the built-in `circle` visual is a fixed ~0.3-world ball. So `collider sphere 0.3`
> is actually a **1.5-world** sphere — 5× the ball you see. A collider much bigger than its visual will
> trip a zone while the *visible* object is still far outside it (and stay "inside" across a whole swing,
> so enter/exit fire far less often than the visible passes suggest). Stick with the automatic shape, or
> match the ball explicitly with `collider sphere 0.06` (`0.06 × 5 = 0.3` world).

### Continuous presence — `areaStay`

`areaStay` reports each body **currently inside** the zone, every physics frame, throttled
**per body** by `maxRate` (Hz):

```
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/on", "areaStay", "/zone/presence", "maxRate", 20)
s("/ms/scene/zoneA/payload", "areaStay", "self", "other", "otherx", "othery", "otherspeed")
s("/ms/physics", "enable", 1)
# -> /zone/presence zoneA note17 0.12 -0.03 0.4   (~20 Hz per contained body)
```

Use the `other*` payload fields (`otherx`, `othery`, `otherz`, `othervx`, `othervy`, `othervz`,
`otherspeed`) to report where each contained body is and how fast it's moving — `x`/`y`/`speed`
describe the zone itself. Filters apply per body: `other <id|prefix*>` and `layer <name>` restrict
which bodies stream.

> `areaStay` runs while the simulation is on (`/ms/physics enable 1`); enter/exit fire
> independently. Constants live in `payload` (the `on` command's trailing tokens are option pairs).

### Event modes, filters & continuous contacts

Every physics/area event binding accepts gating options and an emission `mode`:

```
s("/ms/scene/ball/on", "collisionEnter", "/synth/hit", "minIntensity", 0.2, "cooldown", 0.05)
s("/ms/scene/ball/on", "collisionStay",  "/synth/sustain", "maxRate", 30)   # per-contact, per body
s("/ms/scene/ball/on", "collisionEnter", "/synth/hit", "layer", "percussion")  # only when the other body is on layer "percussion" (name or number)
s("/ms/scene/ball/on", "collisionEnter", "/synth/hit", "mode", "quantized", "quantizeGrid", 0.5)
```

- `collisionStay` reports each body currently touching this rigid body, every frame, throttled per body (like `areaStay` for contacts).
- `layer <name|number>` only fires when the other body is on that collision layer (name registered via `/ms/physics/layer <n> <name>`, or the bit number).
- `mode`: `immediate` (default) sends at once; `queued` flushes at end of frame; `bundle` sends the frame's events as one OSC bundle; `quantized` holds the event until the next transport beat (grid via `quantizeGrid <beats>`, default 1) — requires the transport to be playing.

---

## 9. Displaying scores — every source option

The PNG examples above are just one way to get a score onto a notation object. A score source can
be a **file path**, **inline data sent over OSC**, or **symbolic music that MusicScene engraves at
run-time** — all through the same commands (works identically in 2D and 3D):

```
/ms/scene/<id> notation <format> <source_or_data>   # path OR inline data (auto-detected)
/ms/scene/<id> notationData <format> <data>         # force inline data (text or blob bytes)
/ms/scene/<id> notationSource <source_or_data>      # change source, keep format
/ms/scene/<id> render | reload                       # re-render current source
/ms/scene/<id> page <n> | nextPage | prevPage | pages
/ms/scene/<id> notationInfo                          # <- reply notationInfo <id> <fmt> <src> <backend> <pages>
```

Formats: **`png` `jpg` `webp` `bmp`** (raster) · **`svg`** · **`musicxml` `mei` `lilypond` `abc`**
(symbolic — these need an engraver, see C). `source_or_data` is treated as a **file path** unless
it looks like data (starts with markup `<…`, contains newlines, or is an OSC blob); use
`notationData` to force the inline interpretation.

### A. Raster images (PNG / JPG / WEBP / BMP)

The most robust option — always displays.

```python
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","png","res://scores/page1.png")   # bundled
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","png","user://out/page1.png")     # written at run-time
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","png","D:/scores/page1.png")      # absolute path
```

**Multi-page**: put `{page}` in the path; MusicScene probes how many exist.

```python
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","png","res://scores/p{page}.png")
s("/ms/scene/score","nextPage")
s("/ms/scene/score","pages")     # <- reply pages score <count>
```

**Raw bytes over OSC** (a generated image, no file on disk) — send the PNG bytes as an OSC **blob**.
Mind the UDP datagram cap (~64 KB), so this suits small images / per-system updates:

```python
# minimal blob-aware send (extends gosc.py):
def osc_blob_msg(addr, *args):
    tt, payload = ",", b""
    for a in args:
        if isinstance(a, (bytes, bytearray)):
            b = bytes(a); tt += "b"
            payload += struct.pack(">i", len(b)) + b + b"\x00"*((4-len(b)%4)%4)
        elif isinstance(a, float): tt += "f"; payload += struct.pack(">f", a)
        elif isinstance(a, int):   tt += "i"; payload += struct.pack(">i", a)
        else: tt += "s"; payload += _ostr(str(a))
    return _ostr(addr) + _ostr(tt) + payload

png = open("measure.png","rb").read()
_send.sendto(osc_blob_msg("/ms/scene/score","notation","png",png), (HOST, SEND_PORT))
```

### B. SVG

```python
# bundled under res:// — Godot imports it (best reliability; shows a FileSystem thumbnail)
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","svg","res://scores/score.svg")
# a file written at run-time (rasterized via Godot's ThorVG)
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","svg","user://gen/score.svg")
# an inline SVG STRING generated at run-time (e.g. Verovio in your client) — no file needed
svg = '<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="800" height="300">...</svg>'
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","svg",svg)
```

The page renders at native pixel size centred on the object — **scale it down if it overflows**:
`s("/ms/scene/score","scale",0.3)`. If a runtime SVG fails to rasterize (some engraver SVGs
use features ThorVG can't handle), import it under `res://` or render to PNG.

### C. Symbolic music (MusicXML / MEI / LilyPond / ABC) — MusicScene runs the engraver

MusicScene can shell out to an external engraver to turn symbolic music into pages, then display and
**cache** the result. Configure a per-format command in *Project Settings*
(`musicscene/notation/engraver/<format>`), using these tokens: `{input} {output} {outbase}
{outdir} {format} {page}`. Quote paths that contain spaces.

```ini
[MusicScene]
notation/engraver/musicxml="\"C:/Program Files/MuseScore 4/bin/MuseScore4.exe\" {input} -o {output} -T 10 -r 200"
notation/engraver/lilypond="\"C:/Program Files/lilypond-2.25.81/bin/lilypond.exe\" --png -dcrop=#t -dresolution=200 -o {outbase} {input}"
notation/engraver/abc="abcm2ps {input} -O {outbase}"
notation/engraver_output="png"   ; what your command writes: "png" (default) or "svg"
```

> **Call the engraver directly** — no helper script needed. MusicScene automatically finds the file the
> engraver actually wrote (it looks for `{output}` plus the common `.cropped`, `-page{N}` and `-N`
> variants that LilyPond/MuseScore produce), so you usually only need to set the engraver's path.
> Quote paths that contain spaces. `res://`/`user://` paths are resolved too, so a bundled wrapper
> script (`tools/ly_to_score.py`, `tools/mscore_to_score.py`) is a portable, auto-detecting
> alternative if you'd rather not hard-code the engraver path.
>
> This project ships **working defaults for LilyPond and MuseScore** — if either is installed, the
> matching format works immediately (set your install path).

#### MuseScore

With MuseScore 4 installed and the default `musicxml` setting above (point it at your MuseScore
binary), engrave **MusicXML / .mxl / .mscz** immediately — from a file or inline:

```python
# from a file (any format MuseScore imports)
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","musicxml","res://scores/example.musicxml")
# inline, generated at run-time
s("/ms/scene/score","notationData","musicxml","<?xml ...><score-partwise> ... </score-partwise>")
```

MuseScore is called directly with `-T` (trim to the music); MusicScene picks up its `out-1.png` page
automatically. (Prefer auto-detecting the binary? Use the bundled `tools/mscore_to_score.py`
wrapper instead.) Note: MuseScore 4 occasionally crashes on a cold start under headless automation —
since rendered pages are cached, a retry succeeds and repeats are instant.

#### LilyPond

With LilyPond installed and the default setting above (point it at your `lilypond` binary), engrave
immediately — from a `.ly` file or inline (send the LilyPond source as the data):

```python
# from a .ly file
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","lilypond","res://scores/example.ly")
# inline / runtime-generated — read the source from a file or build it (mind backslash escaping!)
ly = open("snippet.ly", encoding="utf-8").read()
s("/ms/scene/score","notationData","lilypond",ly)
```

The default command runs LilyPond with `-dcrop=#t` (tight bounding box, no A4 whitespace); LilyPond
writes `…cropped.png`, which MusicScene prefers automatically. For **SVG** output use
`-dbackend=svg … -o {outbase} {input}` and set `engraver_output="svg"`. (Prefer auto-detecting the
binary? Use the bundled `tools/ly_to_score.py` wrapper instead.)

(Or set the generic fallback `notation/external_renderer_path` + `notation/external_renderer_args`
used for any symbolic format.) Then point at a file **or send inline source**:

```python
# from a file
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","musicxml","user://flute.musicxml")
# inline, generated at run-time
xml = '<?xml version="1.0"?><score-partwise> ... </score-partwise>'
s("/ms/scene/score","notationData","musicxml",xml)
```

MusicScene writes inline source to a temp file, runs your command, caches the page under
`user://musicscene_cache/notation/`, and displays it. The engraver runs **once** per
(source, format, page) — repeats are cache hits.

**Engraver tips.** MuseScore and LilyPond are handled by the bundled wrappers
(`tools/mscore_to_score.py`, `tools/ly_to_score.py`) — they deal with per-page output naming and
trimming so you don't have to. For other tools (Verovio `verovio -f musicxml -t png -o {outbase}
{input}`, ABC via `abcm2ps`/`abc2svg`, etc.), wrap anything that names its own outputs in a small
`input output` script — see `tools/mscore_to_score.py` / `tools/stub_engraver.py` for the exact
contract MusicScene expects.

### D. The run-time-generation workflow (the common case)

Pick by score size and tooling:

1. **File + path** (no size limit, best for full pages): your generator writes
   `user://gen/score.(svg|png)`, then `notation svg "user://gen/score.svg"`. Regenerate and call
   `render`/`reload` (or send `notation` again) to refresh.
2. **Inline data over OSC** (no temp file; small/medium or per-measure): `notation svg <svg-string>`
   or `notationData musicxml <xml>`. Watch the ~64 KB UDP cap.
3. **MusicScene engraves symbolic data** (you push MusicXML/LilyPond/ABC, MusicScene renders): configure
   the engraver (C), then `notation musicxml <path-or-inline>`.

You can also drive it from inside Godot (GDScript), e.g. after generating a file:

```gdscript
MusicSceneOSC.script_runner.run_text('/ms/scene/score notation svg "user://gen/score.svg"')
```

### Addressable scores — clickable measures (MuseScore)

For MusicXML via MuseScore, MusicScene can make the score **addressable**: it reads MuseScore's measure
positions, crops to the music, and auto-creates a clickable region per measure.

```python
s("/ms/scene/score","addressable",1)                       # enable
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","musicxml","res://scores/example.musicxml")
# ...a moment later (engraving is async)...
s("/ms/scene/score","measures")    # <- reply measures score 1 <u v w h time> 2 <...> ...
```

Each measure becomes region `m1…mN`; clicking one emits `/ms/event/measure score m<n> <u> <v>`
(bind your own with `region m3 on click /my/addr`). Drive **cursor following** from your sequencer by
sending the current measure as the music plays — optionally with a beat fraction within the bar:

```python
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","show",1)
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","measure",3)       # jump cursor to bar 3
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","measure",3,0.5)   # halfway through bar 3
```

### Following scores — note-level (LilyPond)

For LilyPond, `addressable 1` gives **note-level** addressing and **automatic following**. MusicScene
injects a Scheme tagger so each note carries its musical moment, renders LilyPond's point-and-click
SVG, and extracts every note's time, source `line:char`, and position.

```python
s("/ms/scene/score","addressable",1)
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","lilypond","res://scores/example.ly")   # or notationData lilypond <inline>
# ...a moment later...
s("/ms/scene/score","elements")   # <- reply elements score 0 <when line char u v> 1 <...> ...
```

Each note is region `n0…nK` (click → `/ms/event/note score n<i> <u> <v>`). For a **following
cursor**, just play the transport:

```python
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","show",1)
s("/ms/transport","tempo",120.0)
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","follow",1)   # cursor tracks the transport across the notes
s("/ms/transport","play")
# as it plays you receive: /ms/event/note score n<i> <when> <line> <char>
```

The cursor moves note-to-note in sync with the transport and emits a note event as it passes each
one — driven entirely by MusicScene (no per-note messages from your client needed).

The same works for **MEI / ABC via Verovio** (`pip install verovio`; it's the default engraver for
those). Verovio is the cleanest option — its SVG has stable note ids and a timemap with exact
timing, so addressing + following need no tagging tricks:

```python
s("/ms/scene/score","addressable",1)
s("/ms/scene/score","notation","mei","res://scores/example.mei")
s("/ms/scene/score","elements")
s("/ms/scene/score/cursor","follow",1); s("/ms/transport","play")
```

### Cache management

```python
s("/ms/notation/cache","info")    # <- reply notation/cache info <count> <bytes> <dir>
s("/ms/notation/cache","clear")
```

### Quick reference — source forms

| You have… | Command |
|---|---|
| Bundled PNG/SVG | `notation png "res://scores/x.png"` · `notation svg "res://scores/x.svg"` |
| A file written at run-time | `notation png "user://…"` / absolute path |
| Multi-page raster | `notation png "res://scores/p{page}.png"` + `nextPage` |
| A generated SVG string | `notation svg "<svg…>"` |
| Generated image bytes | OSC blob: `notation png <bytes>` |
| Symbolic music (file) | configure engraver, `notation musicxml "user://x.musicxml"` |
| Symbolic music (inline) | `notationData musicxml "<…>"` |

## 10. Driving it from a `.ms` script

Instead of sending messages one by one, put them in a text file — one OSC-style command per line,
`#` for comments, quoted strings stay strings:

`res://my_score.ms`
```text
# A tiny scene
/ms/scene clear
/ms/scene/score new notation
/ms/scene/score notation png "res://scores/page1.png"
/ms/scene/score scale 0.9
/ms/scene/score/cursor show 1
/ms/scene/score/cursor map 0 8 x 0.05 0.95
/ms/transport play
```

Run it over OSC:

```python
s("/ms/script/load", "res://my_score.ms")
```

…or from GDScript (e.g. in your `Main` scene's `_ready`, after a short delay so the autoload has
booted):

```gdscript
await get_tree().create_timer(0.5).timeout
MusicSceneOSC.script_runner.run_file("res://my_score.ms")
```

The bundled examples (`addons/musicscene/examples/ExampleMain.tscn` and `ExampleMain3D.tscn`) do
exactly this.

## 11. Connecting from Max / Pd / SuperCollider

MusicScene speaks plain OSC over UDP. Send to **`127.0.0.1:7400`** and listen on **`7401`**.

- **Max/MSP:** `[udpsend 127.0.0.1 7400]` and `[udpreceive 7401]`. Build messages like
  `/ms/scene/ball new circle`. Floats/ints are inferred from your atoms; wrap text in quotes
  for paths.
- **Pure Data:** `[netsend -u -b]` to `127.0.0.1 7400` with `[oscformat]`, and `[netreceive -u -b]`
  on `7401` with `[oscparse]`.
- **SuperCollider:**

  ```supercollider
  n = NetAddr("127.0.0.1", 7400);
  n.sendMsg("/ms/scene/ball", "new", "circle");
  n.sendMsg("/ms/scene/ball", "pos", 0.0, 0.5);
  // listen for events:
  OSCdef(\hit, { |m| m.postln }, "/synth/hit");
  ```

To make MusicScene send replies/events to a **specific** host/port (e.g. a different machine):

```
/ms/app/output 192.168.1.50 9001
```

---

## 12. Permissions & safety

Conservative defaults keep an open OSC port from doing anything dangerous:

- **Bind** only OSC-exposed nodes (add `OscExposable` or `set_meta("osc_expose", true)`).
- **Instantiate** only whitelisted scenes — `res://osc_spawnable/` is allowed by default; add more
  with `/ms/assets/allowPrefix "res://my_prefab/"` or `/ms/assets/allowScene "<path>"`.
- **Call methods / set properties** only on exposed members (`osc_methods`, `osc_properties` on
  `OscExposable`).
- **Free nodes** is off.

For frictionless local prototyping, set `musicscene/developer_mode = true` to relax all of this.

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| No `[MusicSceneOSC] ready` in Output | Enable the **MusicScene** plugin (Project Settings → Plugins); make sure the `MusicSceneOSC` autoload exists. |
| No `/ms/pong` | Check the client sends to `127.0.0.1:7400` and **listens on 7401**. A firewall prompt may block UDP — allow it. |
| Replies go nowhere on a remote box | Set the target: `/ms/app/output <host> <port>`. |
| Objects don't appear (2D) | They're created at the viewport centre in normalized coords; make sure your main scene is running and nothing covers them. Try `s("/ms/scene/title","new","text","hi")`. |
| Nothing visible (3D) | Confirm `space="3d"` (console says `space=3d`) and that a camera exists (the addon auto-creates one). Objects spawn near the origin inside a ±5-unit cube. |
| `permission_denied` on bind/call/instantiate | The node/member/scene isn't exposed/whitelisted. Expose it, whitelist it, or enable developer mode. |
| 3D changes ignored | `musicscene/space` is read once at startup — **restart** after changing it. |
| MusicXML/MEI fails with `load_failed` | Configure an external engraver in `musicscene/notation/external_renderer_*`, or pre-render to PNG/SVG. |
| SVG score not visible | Put the `.svg` under `res://` (it loads via Godot's import — confirm it shows a thumbnail in the FileSystem dock). The page renders at native size centred on the object, so **scale it down** (`/ms/scene/score scale 0.3`) if it overflows. If the SVG shows no thumbnail, ThorVG can't rasterize it — export to PNG instead. Check the Output panel for a `load_failed` warning. |

## Volumetric shapes & lighting (3D)

In 3D mode you can build real solids, not just flat tokens:

    new mysphere sphere            # a lit ball
    new mybox box 0.4 0.4 0.4      # a lit box
    new mycyl cylinder 0.2 0.6     # a lit cylinder (radius, height)

These are **lit** by default. MusicScene adds a default key + fill light to 3D scenes automatically, so
solids read as volumes out of the box (it steps aside if your scene already has a light). `circle`
stays flat/unshaded — it's the classic INScore token; use `sphere` when you want a 3D ball.

Tweak the look per object:

    /ms/scene/mybox roughness 0.2      # shinier
    /ms/scene/mybox metallic 0.8
    /ms/scene/mysphere shaded 0        # force flat

Or globally: `/ms/scene shading flat` for the classic all-flat look, `shaded` to also light flat
`rect` panels (walls/floors), `auto` for the default. Adjust the light with `/ms/light energy 2`,
`/ms/light dir 0 -1 -0.5`, `/ms/light color 1 0.9 0.8`, or turn on shadows with
`/ms/light shadows 1`.

## Monitoring alongside your client (multiple output ports)

Only one process can bind a UDP port, so a monitor and your client can't both listen on 7401. Tell
MusicScene to mirror its output to several ports instead:

    /ms/app/output 127.0.0.1 7401 7402

Now a client on 7401 and a monitor on 7402 each receive every reply and event. You can also set it
statically in Project Settings under `musicscene/network/send_ports` (e.g. `"7401,7402"`). Send
`/ms/info` to see the active ports.

## Collision reactors: bouncers & portals

**Bouncers** are bumpers: a ball that touches one is mirror-reflected and kicked outward. **Portals** teleport
a ball to a linked partner. Both are Area objects (auto-enabled) that still fire `areaEnter`, so you can
hang sound on them.

```python
# a bumper that kicks any ball that touches it
s("/ms/scene/bump1", "new", "bouncer")
s("/ms/scene/bump1/collider", "sphere", 0.12)
s("/ms/scene/bump1", "pos", 0.5, 0.6, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/bump1/bouncer", "strength", 3.0)      # outward kick; gain defaults to 1.0
s("/ms/scene/bump1/on", "areaEnter", "/pinball/bumper")   # emit OSC on every hit

# two portals: a ball entering p1 pops out of p2 keeping its speed
s("/ms/scene/p1", "new", "portal"); s("/ms/scene/p1/collider", "sphere", 0.1); s("/ms/scene/p1", "pos", 0.2, 0.5, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/p2", "new", "portal"); s("/ms/scene/p2/collider", "sphere", 0.1); s("/ms/scene/p2", "pos", 0.8, 0.5, 0.0)
s("/ms/scene/p1/portal", "link", "p2")             # directional: p1 -> p2
```

`strength`/`minSpeed` are in normalized units — the same scale as a collider radius. Reactors are pass-through
(they don't physically block) — contain a play area with static walls that have `bounce`.

## Next steps

- **Creative example — a physics-driven sequencer:** `examples/python/example_chaos_globe.py` seals several
  balls in a box and slowly **rotates the direction of gravity**, so they tumble chaotically forever
  (an inexhaustible energy source — unlike a pendulum, which the engine's damping quickly winds down).
  Five pentatonic sensor zones in a ring emit `/music/note <zone> <note> <speed>` as balls pass
  through — a never-repeating melody driven by real physics. Run the project in 3D, then
  `python examples/python/example_chaos_globe.py`, and point a synth at `/music/note`. It ties together gravity
  control, sensor zones, payload constants, and `otherspeed`. A **SuperCollider** port,
  `examples/supercollider/example_chaos_globe.scd`, drives the board *and* synthesises the notes locally (a warm,
  reverberant bell panned to each zone's place in the ring).
- **Joints example:** `examples/python/example_pendulum_joints.py` builds a hinge-linked double pendulum whose
  tip strikes the same pentatonic pads — a focused demo of joints + sensor zones. (It swings and then
  settles, so it's a linkage demo rather than the endless generator above.) A **SuperCollider** port,
  `examples/supercollider/example_pendulum_joints.scd`, plays each pad as a soft marimba/mallet, panned across the swing.
- **Pachinko music box:** `examples/python/example_pachinko.py` rains small balls through an offset peg grid into
  five pentatonic bins — a gravity-fed generative sequencer. Shows sizable primitives (`new circle <r>`
  for small balls/pegs), `physics planar` (keeps them in-plane so the bins keep firing), and
  event-driven recycling (the client re-drops each ball the instant it lands). A **SuperCollider**
  port, `examples/supercollider/example_pachinko.scd`, drives the same board over OSC *and* synthesises the two reply
  streams locally — a bell for `/music/note`, a percussive plink for `/music/pin` — so it needs no
  external synth. Boot the server, then evaluate the block.
- **Generative pinball (SuperCollider):** `examples/supercollider/example_pinball.scd` — a self-contained
  pinball table using bouncers, portals, sensor-zone targets, bouncy walls and pins; all sound synthesised
  locally. Boot the project in 3D and evaluate the block.
- Full command list and reply/error reference: **[README.md](README.md)** (API reference section).
- **Advanced mechanics & edge cases: [ADVANCED.md](ADVANCED.md)** — deep dives on notation overlays,
  `discover`, bulk binding, the permission model, `payload` and signal forwarding, emission modes, and
  continuous physics events, each with the non-obvious gotchas.
- Worked examples: `addons/musicscene/examples/` (Godot 2D/3D scenes), `examples/python/` and `examples/supercollider/` (OSC client demos), and `tools/osc_test.py` (reference client).
